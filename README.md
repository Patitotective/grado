This website implements 2D cinematic simulations using `matter-js`.

## Building
To build the frontend, run:
```
nimble frontend
```
It will generate a `frontend.js` file in `public/js`.

To build the backend, run:
```
nimble build
```
It will generate a binary `app` (or `app.exe`) that will host the page locally.
If you want to build and run the backend, run:
```
nimble run
```
